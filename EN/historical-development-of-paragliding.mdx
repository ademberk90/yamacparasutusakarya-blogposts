By the early 1980s, paragliding had become popular in the United States. During this period, new materials were developed for paragliding, leading to safer flights by athletes. In 1985, the first paragliding world championship took place, further boosting the sport's popularity.

In the 1990s, paragliding started to spread globally. Advanced materials and equipment were produced for paragliding during this period, reducing the risk of serious injuries among athletes. Additionally, various competitions and events for paragliding began to be organized.

Today, paragliding has become a popular sport worldwide. Athletes can take off from high mountains, coastal areas, and other elevated locations to enjoy paragliding. New materials and technological equipment developed for paragliding have made the sport even safer.

In conclusion, the historical development of paragliding began in Europe in the late 1970s and became a popular sport worldwide by the 1990s. The development of new materials and technological equipment for paragliding has enhanced safety, allowing athletes to experience thrilling moments while paragliding.

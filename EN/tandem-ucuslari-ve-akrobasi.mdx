Aerobatic maneuvers performed during tandem paragliding flights add even more excitement to the flying experience. Here's more information about these maneuvers:

1. **Wingover**: Wingover is a maneuver that involves the paraglider's wing swinging from side to side, adding a thrilling dimension to the flight experience.

2. **Spiral**: The spiral maneuver increases the descent speed of the paraglider. During this maneuver, the paraglider is rotated from side to side, enhancing the sensation of speed and increasing adrenaline levels. Passengers may experience G-forces during this maneuver.

3. **Dolphins**: The dolphins maneuver involves the paraglider moving in a rolling motion, creating a unique sensation during the flight. It adds an extra dimension to the flying experience.

4. **Helico**: The helico maneuver rotates the paraglider along a horizontal axis, providing a different sensation during the flight. This maneuver adds a twist to the flying experience but should always be performed by an experienced pilot.

Before participating in tandem paragliding flights, make sure to learn about safety rules and equipment and fly with an experienced pilot. When performing these maneuvers, always follow the pilot's instructions carefully and prioritize safety.
